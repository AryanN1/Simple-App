# Simple-App
This was my first assignment from my UCLA Extension JS Online course
A simple Area and Perimter App using Javascript.
When you open the html the page asks you for a Length and then a Width
This is what you will see when its done:
The A and P App
Length = 12
Width = 12

Area = 144
Perimeter = 48

Thanks for using the A and P App :)
